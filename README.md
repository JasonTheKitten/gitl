# Git Lua

gitl is meant to be a custom git client written for Lua.

This project utilizes [SafeteeWoW's LibDeflate](https://github.com/SafeteeWoW/LibDeflate) and [Mpeterv's SHA-1](https://github.com/mpeterv/sha1).

If running on PUC Lua, you will also need to install [LuaFileSystem](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luafilesystem).
