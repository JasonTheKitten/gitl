## gitl

Welcome to gitl, a git-based VCS designed for a variety of Lua environments!

This project utilizes [Mpeterv's SHA-1](https://github.com/mpeterv/sha1) and [Alex Kloss's Base64](http://lua-users.org/wiki/BaseSixtyFour).

If running on PUC Lua, you will also need to install [LuaFileSystem](https://github.com/lunarmodules/luafilesystem) and [Lua-HTTP](https://github.com/daurnimator/lua-http).
